# FORK INFO
This is taken from bojanraic's Spicetify Extension for side-hide to alter for myself.
The purpose of this personal project is to gain some skill in using Github
(and get rid of that annoying video button)

## [Side-Hide](./side-hide/README.md)

Side Hide (SH) is a simple Spicetify extension that hides the Spotify Now Playing and Friend Activity Views in the sidebar and associated buttons. Queue and Connect functionality is unchanged. *(For more flexibility, see [SidebarCustomizer](#sidebarcustomizer) below)*
